# 👋 Hi, I'm Amine — NLP & AI Engineer Building Useful AI Agents

## 🌍 About Me

I’m a hands-on Machine Learning and AI developer working across two main areas:

- **Data Science & Predictive Modeling**  
  Solving real-world problems using regression, classification, and anomaly detection—building clean, production-ready pipelines that deliver actual value.

- **AI Agents & Chatbots**  
  Designing and deploying intelligent assistants and RAG-based systems, managing everything from retrieval logic to real-world deployment.

I cover the entire project lifecycle: dockerizing applications, deploying to AWS/Azure/GCP, and ensuring long-term reliability in production.

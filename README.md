# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

## 🌟 About Me

Hello! I’m a **hands-on Machine Learning and AI developer** working across two main areas:

- 🧮 **Data Science & Predictive Modeling**: I solve real-world problems using regression, classification, and anomaly detection, building **clean, production-ready pipelines** that actually deliver results.  

- 🤖 **AI Agents & Chatbots**: I design and build intelligent assistants and **RAG-based systems**, handling everything from retrieval logic to full deployment in real-world environments.

I don’t just stop at coding models—I handle the entire lifecycle: **Dockerizing applications**, deploying them on **Azure or GCP**, and ensuring they run reliably in production.  

I aim to leverage my skills to create impactful projects while sharing my learning journey.
